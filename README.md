# C-Programming-Core
A comprehensive collection of C implementations covering fundamental algorithms, recursive logic, modular system design via function pointers, and string processing.


C-Programming-Core
This repository documents my progression through core Computer Engineering concepts in C, ranging from basic algorithms to advanced memory and logic management.

📂 Project Structure
Algorithms: Array manipulation, Bubble Sort, and recursive power functions.

Modular-Systems: Practical applications of function pointer arrays and dispatch tables.

Text-Processing: String tokenization, Pig Latin translation, and substring searching.

🚀 Getting Started
VS Code
Open the terminal (Ctrl + ~).

Compile: gcc foldername/filename.c -o output

Run: ./output

Code::Blocks
Open any .c file and press F9 to Build and Run.
